    <h1> Acadia National Park </h1>
    <h2> Background </h2>

    <p id="column_width"> Acadia National Park is an American national park located along the mid-section of the Maine
       coast, southwest of Bar Harbor. The park preserves about half of Mount Desert Island, part of the Isle au Haut,
       the tip of the Schoodic Peninsula, and portions of 16 smaller outlying islands. It protects the natural beauty
       of the rocky headlands, including the highest mountains along the Atlantic coast. Acadia boasts a glaciated
       coastal and island landscape, an abundance of habitats, a high level of biodiversity, clean air and water, and
       a rich cultural heritage.</p>
